# Readings: Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
I encountered syntax errors when I created functions and for loops. They were both corrected by finding the missing element or adding the correct variable.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Detecting errors requires a good skillset.  In my long term goals I'd like to incorporate this into my daily tools to make me a better coder.  I believe I will become better at detecting errors the more a practice and create code.
The JavaScript Debugger.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

## Define what a breakpoint is.
Breakpoints are used to pause code execution.

## What is the call stack?
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
