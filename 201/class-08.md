# Readings: CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension. It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. Flex items move as a group on the main axis.
The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis,

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

## What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Flexbox not only helps lay the sidebar and content out inline, but where there's not enough space remaining, the sidebar will break onto a new line. Instead of setting rigid dimensions for the browser to follow, with flexbox, you can instead provide flexible boundaries to hint how the content could display.
