# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

## What are some advantages to creating object literals?
Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.
## How do objects differ from arrays?
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
An array enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name.

## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
An object property name can be any JavaScript string or symbol Links to an external site., including an empty string. However, you cannot use dot notation to access a property whose name is not a valid JavaScript identifier. For example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, that starts with a number, or that is held inside a variable can only be accessed using the bracket notation. 

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
This refers to Age 2.  It allows you multiply the Age number times seven.
Introduction To The DOM Links to an external site.

## What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
