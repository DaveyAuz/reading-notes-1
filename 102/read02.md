# Markdown Notes - Read 02

Chosing the right text editor is vital to begin your journey into coding.  Once you gain familiarity using a good text editor, your ability to code will increase.  As I gain knowledge on using GitHub, Ubunto, and VS Code I felt that certain features were vital to mention for a good user experience. 

When choosing a reliable text editor please note the following classifications when identifying beneficial features:

- code completion
- syntax highlighting
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

A command line or a termainal, is a text based interface into the system. As you enter commands on your keyboard the system will output text.  

I'm learning that working in terminals and writing code will become a part of my daily routine. How to input the correct commands will take time to learn.  Allow yourself time and patience to master how sytems like these are used and implemented.

Here is an example of how input and output will display in a terminal:
