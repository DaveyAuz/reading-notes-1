# Design web pages with CSS

# What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

# What is CSS for?

As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.

## Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS: External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page

- Internal CSS: An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

- Inline CSS: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

# CSS Color

**Definition and Usage**

The color property specifies the color of text.

Tip: Use a background color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.
