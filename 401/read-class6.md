# Java OO Tutorial (review Object and Class, read the rest)

What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?
An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software in this manner.  

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java.
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. This section explains how classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses, and explains how to derive one class from another using the simple syntax provided by the Java programming language.

# Java Static Keyword

Static methods are also called what? Why?

Static methods are also called class methods. It is because a static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.  And we can invoke static methods directly using the class name.

How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?
If we want to access the static member from inside the class, it can be accessed directly

# Java Singleton Class

What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.
A design pattern is like our code library that includes various coding techniques shared by programmers around the world.

What is a Singleton?
Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.
