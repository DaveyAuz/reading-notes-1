## Prep: The Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the key to learning and evolving.  I often wish that I would have discovered this concept sooner in my life to further my goals and accelerate my career path.  Obstacles are in constant throughout our lives and at times the difficulty level increases.  Learning and correcting our mistakes is critical to our growth to accomplish our goals.  I often struggle with learning and never feel I perform as well as I should with studying and tests.  Due to a necessity to sustain I often found that I had minimum time to strengthen my learning abilities and focus my interests.  I truly wish I would have developed more grit at an early age.  If I had access to more resources and opportunities I'm sure I would have been more successful.  My biggest challenge has been overcoming failure.  In addition to balancing a work-life and earning, trying to succeed become overwhelming.  I like Alain's statement of judgment and ridicule pertaining to failure.  Each of us wakes up with a yearning to be more and achieve more.  If we can eliminate the anxiety about what the outside world thinks or feels, I believe we can acquire a more confident growth mindset free of fear.
