# Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

Explain the difference between an object and a class.
An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software in this manner.  A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

Name two types of state that a Student object might have.
on and off

Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.
turn on, turn off)


# Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section)

Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.
A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarations—except that they use the name of the class and have no return type. For example, Bicycle has one constructor.

Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).
class Student
