## nosql vs sql

# Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

# SQL	NoSQL
 Data uses Schemas	 Schema-less
 Relations	 No (or very few) Relations
 Data is distributed across multiple tables	 Data is typically merged / nested in a few collections
 Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible; Vertical scaling is possible	 Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
 Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second	Great performance for mass (simple) read & write requests

# What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
All data is good for SQL.
# Give a real world example.
A contact form.
# What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Large amounts of data.
# Give a real world example.
Document databases.
# Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
# Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL databases are vertically scalable.
NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

# What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
# What is a relational database?
Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way.

tables for products
# What is a ‘schema’?

# What is a NoSQL database?
There are no relations in this type of database
# How does it work?
Less relation merging, fast and efficient queries.
# What is inside of a MongoDB database?
Databases, Collections, and Documents
# Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
With MongoDB, you don’t have schema constraints, which makes MongoDB more flexible than SQL.
# What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
If you have duplicate data and have products changes you have update all of the collections of data.
