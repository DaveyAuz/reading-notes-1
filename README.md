# Reading-notes

My name is Darshon Crudup (he/him) and I'm excited to be a part of the CodeFellows collective! I'm a Army Veteran as well as a graphic designer and filmmaker who also writes children's books (Baby Casey and the Golden Cookie) (Nufee's Adventure). I decided to enter the tech industry to transition into a new profession which will increase my earning potential. We've just begun our journey but I'm very anxious to learn more in order to hone my skills.  Open to feed back.  Thanks.

## The Growth Mindset - Course 102d49 :calendar:^2022^

***Explained by Darshon Crudup***

Explantion:  The growth mindset is a structured tool for combatting learning obstacles and overcoming them.  If you develop a growth mindset, it will aid you in maneuvering around challenges.  In order to get smarter and absorb new information we must prepare our minds to adjust and adapt so we can accomplish our learning objectives.
